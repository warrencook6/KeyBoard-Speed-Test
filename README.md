# KeyBoard-Speed-Test
A keyboard typing test thingy

This was one of my first real project that had alot of features and moving parts to go with it. First, whenever you type depending on the letter that you press, that letter need to highlight and then check that input against the current letter that is in the array of words to see if it was the correct letter. If it was correct it gives you a checkmark but if you were wrong, it will give you an 'x'. The yellow bar at the top of the page is following the current letter that you need to input and moving as you press any of the keys. At the end you will get a notification on your WPM and gives you another chance to retry the test.
